# Conditions

During the execution of your game's code, not everything needs to be
executed every frame. This is where conditions come in!

## Run Conditions

In Planck, we can assign *Run Conditions* to Systems, Phases, and Pipelines.
Run Conditions are very simple, they are just functions that return true or
false.

We can set a Run Condition on a System/Phase/Pipeline like so,

```lua
local function condition(world)
    if someCondition then
        return true
    else
        return false
    end
end

local scheduler = Scheduler.new(world)
    :setRunCondition(systemA, condition)
    :setRunCondition(somePhase, condition)
    :setRunCondition(somePipeline, condition)
```

## Common Conditions

Planck provides several built-in conditions for you to use as
Run Conditions.

:::tip
Some conditions, like `onEvent` have secondary purposes.

You can use conditions themselves in systems, and conditions
like `onEvent` will also create a `collectEvents` function which
you can use to handle events inside of your systems.
:::

### Time Passed (Throttle)

Sometimes, we only want our systems to run on specific intervals. We can
use the `timePassed` condition:

```lua
local Planck = require("@packages/Planck")

local Scheduler = Planck.Scheduler
local timePassed = Planck.timePassed

local scheduler = Scheduler.new(world)
    :setRunCondition(systemA, timePassed(10)) -- Run every 10 seconds
```

It's important to note that `systemA` will still be ran on
`RunService.Heartbeat`. Our time will tick up until it reaches the given
interval when the event fires again.

### Run Once

In Planck, we have Startup Phases built-in. You might want to recreate
something akin to these if you're not using the built-in Phases.

```lua
local Planck = require("@packages/Planck")

local Scheduler = Planck.Scheduler
local runOnce = Planck.runOnce

local scheduler = Scheduler.new(world)
    :setRunCondition(systemA, runOnce()) -- Run only once
```

### On Event

We might want to run a system only when there are any new events since last
frame.

```lua
local Planck = require("@packages/Planck")

local Scheduler = Planck.Scheduler
local onEvent = Planck.onEvent

local scheduler = Scheduler.new(world)
    -- Run out system only when there is a new Player
    :setRunCondition(systemA, onEvent(Players.PlayerAdded))
```

It is important to note that we don't actually collect the events using
this condition. You will have to do that yourself.

```lua
local Players = game:GetService("Players")

local Planck = require("@packages/Planck")

local onEvent = Planck.onEvent
local hasNewEvent, collectEvents = onEvent(Players.PlayerAdded)

local function systemA()
    for i, player in collectEvents() do
        -- Do something
    end
end

return {
    system = systemA,
    runConditions = { hasNewEvent }
}
```

### Not

This is a really simple condition, it just inverses the condition passed.

```lua
local Planck = require("@packages/Planck")

local Scheduler = Planck.Scheduler
local onEvent = Planck.onEvent
local isNot = Planck.isNot

local scheduler = Scheduler.new(world)
    -- Run our system only when there is a new Player
    :setRunCondition(systemA, isNot(onEvent(Players.PlayerAdded)))
```

## Ideas for Conditions

### Player Alive

In Roblox, we typically have a Player with a Humanoid. It might make sense
to only run some systems when the Player is alive.

Here's a write up for what that might look like for a client system,

```lua
-- Player singleton
local LocalPlayer = world:component()
world:set(LocalPlayer, LocalPlayer)
world:set(LocalPlayer, Health, 100)

local function playerAlive()
    return function(world)
        local health = world:get(LocalPlayer, Health)

        if health > 0 then
            return true
        else
            return false
        end
    end
end

local scheduler = Scheduler.new(world)
    -- Run the system only when the Player is alive
    :setRunCondition(systemA, playerAlive())
```

This helps us to avoid unnecessarily running systems that only have behavior
when the Player is alive.

## Run Conditions Are Not Dependencies

Your systems should *not* depend on conditions. In the context of your
system, it should not matter whether a Run Condition is true or false,
the system should work.

The purpose of Run Conditions are to minimize the amount of systems that
are running during a frame, by cutting out systems which do not need to
run in a given moment.
