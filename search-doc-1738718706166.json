While your systems and game as a whole should be able to function still with these issues present, the effect of it is visible latency in your game.  This was briefly introduced in Introduction under 'Does any of this really matter?'.  Let's say we have systemA and systemB. systemAmodifies data in our world which systemB depends on. If systemA runs after systemB, then systemB will have to wait a whole frame for the modifications to be made.  When a system has to wait a whole frame for an operation it depends on, we introduce latency into our game. This latency has the potential to be visible to players, who call it lag.  The best way to address this is by assigning systemA andsystemB to different Phases, with systemA's Phase runningbefore systemB's Phase.  We will go into detail on when to create a Phase, what Phases systems should be assigned to, and more later on.

For example,  local scheduler = Scheduler.new() :insert(phaseA) :insert(phaseB) :runAll()   phaseA will run before phaseB when we do scheduler:runAll(). In this scenario, phaseA is a dependency of phaseB, where phaseAmust run before phaseB.  Systems don't have any dependencies, they are only ordered by insertion within a phase,  local scheduler = Scheduler.new() :addSystem(systemA) :addSystem(systemB) :runAll()   So, systemA runs before systemB.  You can create dependencies for Phases/Pipelines explicitly too by usingScheduler:insertAfter() and Scheduler:insertBefore().  local scheduler = Scheduler.new() :insert(phaseA) :insertAfter(phaseB, phaseA) :runAll()   phaseB now depends on phaseA, meaning it can't run until phaseA runs.

While you can set the phase directly in Scheduler:addSystem(fn, phase), it may be convenient to use a System Table instead.  note Notice how we pass world into our system functions instead of requiring the module we made. We do this to keep systems pure, we avoid external dependencies by passing our dependencies as function parameters. This makes our systems more testable and reusable.
